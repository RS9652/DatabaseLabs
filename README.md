Database Class Labs

This repository contains all laboratory exercises, assignments, and projects completed for my Database class. Each lab demonstrates concepts learned during the course, including:

Creating and modifying tables

Inserting, updating, and deleting data

Querying data using SQL (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, etc.)

Working with constraints, indexes, and relationships

Using PostgreSQL as the database management system

Repository Structure:
Folders:
/Lab1 - 
/Lab2 - 
...
/LabN - 

Since Lab01 and Lab02 are PostgreSQL RDMS installation instructions, they are not included, thus, we actually start from Lab03. So here is labs from 3-17 with the naming starting from Lab03 as Lab01.
